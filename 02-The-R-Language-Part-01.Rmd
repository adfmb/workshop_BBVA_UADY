#The R Language: Part 01

## Command prompt
Type commands on the line tat begins with a `>` sign (known as the prompt). When you hit enter, Rstudio will run your command and display any output below it
```{r}
1+1
```
R displays an indez next to th eoutput; **ignore it**. It`s helpful when R return more than one value in the output
```{r}
seq(300)
```

## R: the fancy calculator
```{r}
5+5
4-1
1*2
4^2
```

```{r}
a<-3
b<-6

a
b

a+b
(a*b)^23

sqrt(3434567);sqrt(3434567.456*567*432-23456+789-4+45)
```

### Arithmetic with R

In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
- Modulo: `%%`

The last two might need some explaining:

- The `^` operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example `3^2` is `9`.
- The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or `5 %% 3` is 2.

With this knowledge, follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.

**Instructions**
- Type `2^3` in the editor to calculate 2 to the power 5.
```{r}
2^3
```
- Type `28 %% 6` to calculate 28 modulo 6.
```{r}
28 %% 6
```

- Note how the `#` symbol is used to add comments on the R code.

```{r}
print("   Hola FMAT :*)     ") ## This is an useless comment just to show that we can write one of these by side our code to help us remember why do we put those commands on our script/algorithm
```

```{r}

```
